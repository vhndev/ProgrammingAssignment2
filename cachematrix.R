## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  s <- NULL
  set <- function(y){
    x <<- y
    s <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setSolve <- function(solve) s <<- solve
  getSolve <- function() s
  list(set = set, get = get, setSolve = setSolve, getSolve = getSolve)
}

## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" 
## returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
## then cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  s <- x$getSolve()
  if (!is.null(s)){
    message("Getting cache data")
    return(s)
  }
  s <- solve(x$get())
  x$setSolve(s)
  s
}
